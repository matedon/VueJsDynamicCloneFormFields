#Vue.js @ Dynamic Clone Form Fields

This little example shows you, how to build a form clone Vue.js application.

There could be several situations where you need to duplicate some form elements, to clone one or more input fields and provide a plus (+) and a minus (-) buttons to add or remove them.

This example application implements an appartment management form, where you can handle more appartments with price and the number of rooms.

To test the form submitted array, there are some optional jQuery code. You are free to remove that.
